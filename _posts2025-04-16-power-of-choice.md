## The Power of Choice

*Hate him or admire him, but you simply can’t ignore Achyuta Samanta* — the visionary founder of KIIT (Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology), KISS, and KIMS in Bhubaneswar. 

Unlike many stodgy, one-size-fits-all institutions — including elite IITs, IIMs, and top-tier private B-schools — Samanta has consistently stood for **optional dignity**. Whether it's **air-conditioned hostel rooms** at a premium for those who can afford them, or **priority access to medical care** at KIMS via a paid superspeciality ward, he doesn't shy away from offering people **the choice**.

> *If someone can afford convenience and is short on time, he ensures the system has a path that respects their needs — without taking away anything from others.*

### Case in Point: My Visit to KIMS

Earlier today, I had to consult a doctor at KIMS. The hospital presented two options:

- **Option 1:** Go to the general OPD, wait in a crowded queue of 40+ patients, and consult the doctor for free.
- **Option 2:** Pay a few hundred rupees, enter the Superspeciality Ward, and enjoy a clean, air-conditioned space with fewer patients and quicker consultation.

As a working professional short on time and able to afford ₹500, I chose the latter.

Was this unfair? I don’t think so. The first option still existed. Nobody was denied care. But *I was given the dignity of choice*.

### Tirumala Tirupati: A Similar Model

Take another example — **Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam**:

- Pay ₹350 and wait 4–5 hours for darshan.
- Pay ₹10,000 (VIP ticket) and complete the darshan in 30 minutes.

This may sound crass to some ears, but it serves an important purpose: **tiered access without denial**.

---

## What We Often Get Wrong: Forced Uniformity

Let me contrast that with a recent example from a **top B-school**:

- Their original MBA fee was ₹30 lakhs. Hostels had no air-conditioning.
- Some affluent parents complained. So, the college raised the fee to ₹35 lakhs — and *mandated* AC hostel rooms for all.

> *This is not choice. This is compulsion masked as improvement.*

What about students who would’ve preferred saving ₹5 lakhs and managing without AC hostels? The institution, in its pursuit of uniformity, ended up punishing affordability.

## The Double Standard in India

In the West, no one complains when such options exist — *fast-track lanes, express consultations, premium seats, or even private healthcare*.

Yet, in India, many scream:  
> “Commercialisation!”  
> “Fleecing the common man!”  
> “Partiality towards the rich!”

Why this hypocrisy?

We live in a **capitalist, resource-constrained democracy**. Fairness isn’t always about making everyone equal — sometimes, it’s about letting each person pick the path that suits their context, without judgement.

---

## In Conclusion

Let’s stop villainising institutions that offer **dignified optionality**. True equity lies not in forced uniformity, but in *respecting diversity of circumstances*.

> *Give people the power to choose — and you give them dignity, agency, and respect.*
