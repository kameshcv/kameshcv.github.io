In management education under BPUT, Odisha, merit is **mangled**!

The maximum number of private and government MBA colleges in Odisha are affiliated with the **Biju Patnaik University of Technology (BPUT)** — a state-run university that umbrellas over **200+ institutions** across engineering, management, pharmacy, and allied disciplines.

### The Education Hub Illusion

Private MBA colleges have mushroomed across **Bhubaneswar**, earning the city the tag of an "education hub" in Eastern India. But behind the façade of growth lies a systemic dilution of standards.

Admissions to MBA colleges under BPUT are routed through the **Odisha Joint Entrance Examination (OJEE)**. But make no mistake — this is no CAT, XAT, or GMAT. There's **no group discussion, no personal interview, no screening for communication skills, extracurriculars, or problem-solving prowess**.

---

### Economics Over Excellence

The BPUT fee structure is tightly regulated — **1/10th of an IIM or elite private B-school**. With fees nearly uniform, students select colleges based solely on two attributes:

1. **Total tuition fee**
2. **Placement record** (however inflated or inconsistent)

Colleges, in turn, maximize profit by **maximizing student intake**, often ignoring metrics like academic rigor, student motivation, or even classroom infrastructure.

---

### Faculty: Underpaid and Undermined

Teaching salaries? **Not even at par with AICTE norms**.

Most faculty in these MBA colleges are paid half of what their counterparts earn in reputed institutions. Some still strive to uphold standards, but most succumb to apathy, constrained by low pay and minimal institutional support.

---

### The Academic Charade

The internal evaluation system is engineered to ensure that **no student fails**.

Failing a subject means **repeating an entire year**, making the student ineligible for placements. As a result, liberal marking is the norm, reducing academic rigor to a formality.

Classroom hours are fixed: **9:30 am to 5:00 pm**, leaving barely any room for group learning, discussions, or soft-skill development. Bright students pull ahead on their own steam. But the rest — often over **50%** — **learn little, pass somehow, and are trained just for placement interviews.**

---

### A Placement Mirage

Final placements are the **Holy Grail**. Colleges offer heavy training in GD-PI but little else. Many students do land jobs — **low-paying, low-skill jobs**. But once the corporate grind begins, the harsh truth sets in:

> Many of these students **quit or are fired** — eventually swelling the ranks of the unemployed.

---

### A System Blunting the Blade of Merit

This is the stark reality of management education under BPUT. With academic excellence sidelined, problem-solving discouraged, and soft-skills left to chance, **the outcome is predictable**:

> A generation of MBA graduates armed with degrees but not with capabilities.

BPUT colleges — despite their size and reach — are inadvertently contributing to **India’s unemployment** due to **systemic distortions** that favor **volume over value**.

*Merit deserves nurturing, not neglect. The system must evolve before it collapses under the weight of its own mediocrity.*
