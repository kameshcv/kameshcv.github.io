The **Summer Internship Project (SIP)** — a two-month corporate stint after the first year of an MBA — is a rite of passage in B-school culture.

In top-tier institutes like IIMs, XLRI, XIMB, SPJIMR, and others, SIPs come with fat stipends, fierce competition, and the holy grail of outcomes — a **Pre-Placement Offer (PPO)**.

For the ambitious, SIPs are not summer vacations but stepping stones to long-term success. Others, especially in tier-2/3 colleges, may treat them as extended summer breaks — often unpaid, often overlooked by disinterested corporates.

### How I landed up in a liquor company

Back in **1990**, I was a greenhorn MBA student at **XIMB**, blissfully unaware of the SIP “battleground”. Unlike peers who jostled for spots at TCS, SAIL, etc., I was headed to **Hyderabad** — a tradition rooted in annual family summer migrations.

Thanks to an uncle’s contact, I secured a SIP at a **liquor company**, leaving behind the usual suspects of structured SIPs.

### First day: Manager, Meet Misery

My manager — a dour man with a hangover-heavy gaze — was clearly unimpressed. Upon learning my project was to analyze why the competitor's brandy was outselling theirs in Hyderabad, he offered a half-smile and suggested I was wasting time.

_"Consumer preference surveys? That's boardroom jazz,"_ he scoffed.

He handed me off to a sales manager and offered no support. Since my stipend was a pittance compared to classmates, I negotiated an unconventional perk: **weekly beer bottles from the office freezer**. A fair barter in the Hyderabad summer, I’d say.

### The project gets spirited

Armed with **factor analysis** and a hunger to do justice to the project (and to my free beer deal), I designed a questionnaire and began visiting **Hyderabad’s bars and liquor stores**.

There was just one hiccup — I had never tasted **brandy or whisky**.

In the name of research, I hit a local bar and tried both. The result? **Zero insight, maximum hangover.**

I trudged through 20 dingy bars, nausea in tow, trying to decode Hyderabad’s obsession with brandy. Eventually, I discovered that locals believed **brandy was medicinal** — even **doctor-recommended**. One popular brand was literally named _Doctor’s Brandy_.

Turns out, brandy _is_ recommended in colder countries. But in the sweltering heat of Hyderabad? A clear case of **cultural misapplication**.

### Classmates, Cafeterias, and Catastrophes

Two of my classmates also did SIPs in Hyderabad. One raved about her hospital’s **canteen** more than HR concepts.

The other managed to **infect the hospital’s entire computer system** with a virus from a floppy disk. Fortunately, networking hadn’t gone mainstream yet — otherwise, his blunder could’ve brought the entire hospital to its digital knees.

### A million cheers... and tears

Back to me — after finishing my report, I submitted it with brand name suggestions and key reasons for the competitor’s brand dominance.

The branch manager, beaming with misplaced confidence, revealed their upcoming brand: **A MILLION CHEERS**. A name, he claimed, coined by a Europe-returned VP, poised to take the market by storm.

Three months later, the news broke: the brand had flopped miserably, withdrawn at **a huge loss**.

### Key takeaway: The customer is the king (even when drunk)

This SIP taught me more than any marketing lecture. **Customer insights are born in smelly bars, not plush boardrooms.** Ignore them at your peril.

And yes — I did receive a final placement offer from a **liquor giant**, who assumed I was adequately seasoned (and sufficiently intoxicated) for the role.

I politely declined.

**Some people make mistakes and learn. I happen to be one of them.**

_That was my SIP._
