**EMPATHY** does not develop in a person naturally; rather, it needs to be cultivated, as per Steven Pinker in his book *The Better Angels of Our Nature*.

Empathy must not be confused with sympathy.

One can be sympathetic towards people in challenging situations — such as physically challenged individuals who beg for money, elderly homeless people, or those living in slums.

Empathy is an altogether different emotion — and a distinct act.

One of my friends in Cuttack distributes chocolates and storybooks to children living in a nearby slum. He also feeds stray dogs daily with biscuits bought from a local paan shop — as exemplified by the Principal of Biju Patnaik Institute of Information Technology and Management (BIITM), Bhubaneswar, Dr Mihir Ranjan Nayak. Another friend of mine in Bangalore has taken in a stray dog as a pet instead of choosing a specific expensive breed. These can be considered acts of empathy.

There are numerous examples I have come across.

There is a Bhubaneswar-based NGO that takes a mobile library full of comics to areas where disadvantaged children live, enabling them to enjoy reading material they would otherwise not have access to. Then there are those engaged in bringing medical specialists to rural areas through online consultancy — as demonstrated by CureBay in Odisha, a startup guided by a close friend, Srijat Mishra.

These are striking examples of empathy in action — and ones we must appreciate and emulate!
