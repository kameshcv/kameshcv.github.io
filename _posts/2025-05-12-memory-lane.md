# BABU 
# _Dhukmana Nai Ho!_

> If memory serves me right—and let’s be honest, it occasionally takes unscheduled tea breaks—the thread that stitched Babu and me together was a noble pursuit of higher education... and an even nobler mode of transport: **the bicycle**.

While others arrived in scooters or autos, Babu and I pedalled our way to graduation—fueled by optimism, sweat, and the occasional puncture.

But Babu wasn’t just another commuter.

He was a **cricket romantic**—a man so deeply committed to imaginary match commentary that Geoffrey Boycott might’ve asked him to tone it down. Every ride to college was a test match in motion: pitch reports, commentary, dramatic replays—served live, _handlebar mic not included_.

Even half-asleep, I couldn’t help but marvel at his energy. While we wiped our eyes, Babu was already into the third over of an imaginary innings.

---

Visiting his home was like stepping into a warm **Doordarshan-era family drama**. His father read newspapers like they were classics. His mother—ever gracious—offered us tall glasses of **Paana** juice. Sweet. Tangy. Summery. Unforgettable.

His younger sister? Just a shy “Hi” before I retreated into awkward silence—teenage boy level: expert.

But it’s the bike rides I remember most.  
Not just the wheels turning, but the _friendship_, the _passion_, the _joy_ of turning the ordinary into a full-blown cricket carnival.

> In a world chasing speed and silence, Babu cycled through life with a mic, a smile, and a heart full of play.

# NEE PANDA  
# _Party Kharab Bhabna Re!_

My first encounter with **Nee**? Science Block. BJB College.  
Setting: chalk dust and curiosity.

A gentle nudge from my senior Tusi and I was off to meet destiny—or at least, a sarcastic Cuttackite.

> “Have you taken Economics Honours? Are you from Bhubaneswar?”

Nee turned, slow and sly. Smiled like a Bond villain on sabbatical.

> “I’m from Cuttack,”  
> and vanished into the crowd, leaving me both intrigued and mildly roasted.

---

Then came college elections—our **budget Game of Thrones**.  
Nee, the self-appointed kingmaker, campaigned for his candidate with the **subtlety of a foghorn** and the **conviction of a messiah**.

I caved. Voted his way.  
Mistake.

Turns out, his “hero” was less Lincoln, more chemically-liberated liability.  
**Union funds vanished. So did events. Democracy wept.**

---

But my opinion of Nee evolved.

Especially after I learned of his fondness for "drinks" during college hours. And no, we weren’t sipping _tender coconut_.

That’s when the friendship took off.

Evenings with **Shashi Sir** became a cocktail of math and mischief. Group theory met raunchy jokes. Sir sighed. We snickered.

And then... the **Ravi Talkies Incident**.

> Mix whiskey, beer, and wine. Add patriotism.  
> Outcome?  
> Me—retching under neem trees.  
> Nee—cradling me like a wounded soldier.  
> A hostelite—joining in like a paramedic.

That moment, my head in Nee’s lap, dignity long gone...  
That’s when I knew—**real friendship doesn’t flinch from puke or punchlines.**

---

# SANTOSH 
# _Don’t Get Ansty!_

Santosh wasn’t born. He **debuted**.  
Walked into college like a slow-motion shampoo ad.  
**Women noticed him.**  
**Men noticed women noticing him.**

My sister? Recognized him immediately.

> “Oh, his sister is in my class!”  
> _Santosh had pre-installed references._

---

Our bond? Forged in a bloodstain.  
I once got into a full-on filmy altercation—outside class.  
There was blood. Reputation. Headlines, if we had any.

> Santosh didn’t flinch.  
> He nodded, like a samurai recognising another.  
> We were in.

Soon, we were hanging out at **Ona Jena’s legendary outhouse**, trading sips of rum for philosophy.

---

Unlike Babu or Nee, Santosh had a constant—**romance**.  
Always missing, always returning like a romantic song’s guitar solo.

We’d ask:  
> “What do you talk about for hours?”

He’d shrug, “This and that.”  
Smooth criminal.

---

He even tried to **Cupid** me.  
Introduced me to girls. I said “Hi.” They said “Bye.”  
Turns out, _romance had caller ID and I was blocked_.

Still, we had epic rides on my **Rajdoot**—the bike that roared like a lion and turned like a cow on roller skates.

---

But the memory that towers above?

> **Puri. The Sea. The Incident.**

Three friends.  
A few too many “drinkies.”  
We ran into the sea.  
The sea... ran off with my pants.

Yes, I was the unintentional star of a public nudist documentary.

Santosh and Nee, loyal to the last robe, helped me back to dignity. One towel at a time.

---

Another Puri trip. This time with “snakes.”  
Me—hungover, horizontal, hopeless.  
Snakes? Gone.  
**Santosh? Still there.**

Shielding my head. Cradling my shame.  
It was **Kabir Singh meets Mother Teresa**.

> That day, sun overhead, shame underfoot—I found a friend who stayed.

---

## _In Closing..._

Some friendships are formed over time.  
Others? Over Paana, punches, puking, and pantless escapades.

Each of them—Babu, Nee, Santosh—reminds me:

> _Life’s best stories are written on dusty roads, under neem trees, and in the invisible ink of memories._  
>  
> And thankfully, some friends—like cassettes—may get dusty, but they still play.
