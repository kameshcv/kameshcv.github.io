Reputed private B-schools in India often showcase tangible assets, modern buildings, manicured lawns, sprawling auditoriums, sports facilities, vibrant food courts serving everything from Italian to Chinese cuisine, and of course, fully air-conditioned classrooms. 

For many institutions, these are seen as key markers of prestige. Administrators believe such physical manifestations foster pride among students and nostalgia among alumni. *In essence, they assume that credibility is built on infrastructure.*

I disagree. 

The credibility of an institution runs far deeper than its architecture or ambience. It lies in the values it upholds, particularly when doing so comes at a cost.

I witnessed a defining moment during my PGDM (MBA) at XIMB, Bhubaneswar (1989–91) — an incident that, in my view, laid the moral foundation of the institution and distinguished it from others in the region.

In its early years (1987–1991), XIMB was like many other B-schools in eastern India. It had good academics, reasonable student engagement, and fair placements. But it lacked national distinction.

That changed with a single, uncompromising decision taken by the late Father R. D'Souza — then Director of XIMB, later founder of Goa Institute of Management, and eventually a Padma awardee.

In 1991, Father D'Souza chose to uphold that clause, not just in spirit but in action. A student who had consistently failed to meet the academic criteria was summarily dismissed. His fees were forfeited. He was not allowed to sit for summer internships or final placements. His PGDM journey ended abruptly.

This action shocked the student body. Sarcastic murmurs filled the campus. How could someone who had cleared the gruelling XAT, group discussions, and personal interviews — the very hurdles that made XIMB elite — be ousted?

To many of us back then, getting *into* XIMB was the real milestone. Everything that followed — academics, internships, placements — felt like a given.

Senior students and faculty appealed to the Director for reconsideration. Emotional pleas were made. Stories of hardship were shared. But Father D’Souza remained resolute.

When political and bureaucratic pressure followed from the corridors of Odisha’s power circles, he still didn’t budge. The student was formally issued a termination letter and asked to vacate the hostel. Only then did the gravity of the decision hit the XIMB community.

Word spread quickly. Other B-schools in Bhubaneswar took notice. Recruiters did too.

Companies that had previously classified XIMB as a Tier-2 institute began reassessing. Students who had treated B-school life as a party punctuated by lectures were jolted into reality.

That one decision — rooted in academic integrity — did more for XIMB’s brand than any building or placement statistic ever could.

It instilled discipline, pride, and seriousness among students. It showed that *rules were not ornamental*, and that values would not be compromised to protect reputation or revenue.

> *This was the moment XIMB stopped being “just another B-school” and began its journey towards national credibility.*

And it all started with a decision — difficult, unpopular, but necessary.

---

*Discipline isn’t built by policies alone, but by the courage to enforce them.*  
This one act of integrity echoed for decades, shaping the institution and its culture.
